AVL Tree implementation for BITS WILP DSAD Assignment.

This solves the below problem statment.

 
## Problem Statement
 
In an attendance monitoring system, the unique integer ID number of every employee is noted whenever the employee enters the organization. First time an employee enters into the office, the corresponding id is set to 1. From then onwards, each time an employee leaves the office premises for tea break or lunch break, and enters back this id is incremented. You can figure out that when this id is odd on a day, he is in the office premises and even when he is out. 
The organization uses this data to perform the following analytics: 
1. How many employees came today? 
2. Did a particular employee come today? 
3. How often did an employee enter into the office? 
4. Which employee moves out of office most number of times? 
5. Who all came within a range of IDs, and how often they entered? 
6. Perform an analysis for the questions above and give the running time in terms of input size,n.
